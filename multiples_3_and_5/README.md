# Multiples 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Observations

* The first form the input values are slices, but I need build a function for delete the repeated
elements because some elements are multiple of 3 and five, the sum of the two slices is wrong!!

See the version 2!
